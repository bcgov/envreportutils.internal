## Overview

An [R](http://r-project.org) package containing templates & internal utility functions for [Environmental Reporting BC](http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=FF80E0B985F245CEA62808414D78C41B).

## Usage

Install with:

```r
## install.packages("devtools") # if not already installed
devtools::install_github("bcgov-c/envreportbc")
```

## Project Status

Relatively stable, but under constant development. This package contains templates for creating products with B.C. Government and Environmental Reporting BC specific branding, and thus is maintained in a private repository.
