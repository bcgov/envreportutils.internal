\description{
Creates the folder structure for a new indicator.
}
\details{
If you are cloning a repository (\code{git_clone = "path_to_repo"}),
  you should run this function from the root of your dev folder and leave 
  \code{path = "."}, as the repository will be cloned into a new folder. If 
  you are setting up a new project (with or without git), \code{path} should 
  be \code{"."} if you are within an already created project directory, or 
  the name of the folder you want to create.
  
  You can see more examples in the package vignette. Type
  \code{browseVignettes("envreportbc")} to view it.
